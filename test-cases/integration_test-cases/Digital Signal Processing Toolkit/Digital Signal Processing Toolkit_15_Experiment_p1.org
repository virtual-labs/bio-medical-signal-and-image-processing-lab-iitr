  - Signal type:Sawtooth,triangular,square,sine,user defined and formulae based

* Objective
  - To perform the Experiment of the Digital Signal Processing Toolkit experiment

* Pre conditions
  - Refer to first test case [[https://github.com/Virtual-Labs/bio-medical-signal-and-image-processing-lab-iitr/blob/master/test-cases/integration_test-cases/Digital Signal Processing Toolkit/Digital Signal Processing Toolkit_01_Usability_smk.org][Digital Signal Processing Toolkit_01_Usability_smk.org]]

* Post conditions
  - Nil
* Test Steps
  1. Refer to step id 14
  2. Select the signal type from the drop down list present at the signal type field
  3. Set frequency,amplitude,phase,sampling frequency,simulation period and DC Bias using the scroll bar ao by manually entering the value at the corresponding fields
  4. Select the type of noise from the drop down list opresent at the noise type field
  5. Click on the Aliasing  radio button
  6. Click on the close(X) botton prsent at the top left corner of the window

* Expected result
  1. Refer to step id 14
  2. Based on the selected signal type,noise type and frequency values the amplitude vs time graph should be displayed on the screen
  3. The Aliasing radio button should get selected

* Review/comments
